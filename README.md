# How to install

If you don't have cocoapods, visit http://www.cocoapods.org or follow the steps below:

~~~
	# Install Commoand Line Tools in Xcode->Preferences->Downloads first.
	sudo gem install cocoapods
	pod setup # Do not sudo here
~~~

If you have Podfile, add ‘RS3DSegmentedControl’. Or follow steps below:

~~~
	# Copy and paste these lines
	echo "platform :ios, ‘6.0’” > Podfile
	echo "pod ‘RS3DSegmentedControl’” >> Podfile
	pod install
	open *.xcworkspace
~~~
This command will generate or edit YourProject.xcworkspace. Open this instead of your original YourProject.xcodeproj.


# Create the view

~~~
	self.segmentedControl = [[RS3DSegmentedControl alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 20, self.view.frame.size.width, 64)];
	_segmentedControl.delegate = self;
	[self.view addSubview:_segmentedControl];
~~~



# Implement the delegate methods:
~~~
	- (NSUInteger)numberOfSegmentsIn3DSegmentedControl:(RS3DSegmentedControl *)segmentedControl;
	- (NSString *)titleForSegmentAtIndex:(NSUInteger)segmentIndex segmentedControl:(RS3DSegmentedControl *)segmentedControl;
	- (void)didSelectSegmentAtIndex:(NSUInteger)segmentIndex segmentedControl:(RS3DSegmentedControl *)segmentedControl;
~~~
